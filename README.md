# mode-one-roughness-data
This is the data for our paper focusing on the effect of roughness on SPS plates. I've provided all the data for plotting the line graphs, but the flow fields are too heavy, so I've added the lotus.f90 and everything is transparent and reproducible.

# ToDo:
- Upload data to pure

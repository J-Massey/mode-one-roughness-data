# mode-one-roughness-data
This is the data for our paper focusing on the effect of roughness on SPS plates. I've provided all the data for plotting the line graphs but the flow fields are too heavy so I've added the lotus.f90 so everything is transparent and reproducible.

# ToDo:
- Finish running the n-bump simulations
- Re-plot the enstrophy
  - Swear very loudly if it's not right.
 - Update the paper
 - Write a blog post summarising the paper.
